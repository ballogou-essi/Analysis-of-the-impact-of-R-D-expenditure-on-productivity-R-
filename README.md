Hi!! 
Our study assesses the impact of research and development (R&D) expenditures on total factor productivity in a sample of 71 upper-middle and high-income countries. 
Productivity will be defined here as a measure of technical progress and therefore of innovation, especially process innovation. Our study then examines the potential determinants of technical progress. The results obtained provide insights into the role of R&D investment policies in stimulating competitiveness and therefore economic growth.
