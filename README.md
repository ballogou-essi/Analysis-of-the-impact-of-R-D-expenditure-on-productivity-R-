# Analysis of the Impact of R&D Expenditure on Productivity 📊
Hi there! 👋

Ever wondered if investing in R&D actually boosts productivity? Well, we did too! Our study explores the link between research & development (R&D) spending and total factor productivity (TFP) across 71 upper-middle and high-income countries.

🔍 Key Takeaways:
✅ R&D is crucial for innovation, but its direct impact on TFP isn't always obvious.
✅ Political stability plays a key role in fostering a productive economy—but too much can slow things down!
✅ Population growth is a game changer, driving economies of scale and market expansion.
✅ We test OLS, 2SLS (instrumental variables), and Gauss-Markov assumptions to ensure robustness.

📌 Methods & Models:

Descriptive analysis: Stats, correlation matrix, R&D expenditure distribution 📊
Regression models: OLS, 2SLS with instruments like regulatory quality & exports
Hypothesis testing: Breusch-Pagan, Sargan’s test for instrument validity

🎯 Conclusion:
R&D spending alone doesn't seem to directly impact productivity—delays, institutional factors, and country-specific differences might explain why. 
Maybe it’s not just how much you invest, but how you use it! 🤔
